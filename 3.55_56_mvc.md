# Model View Controller (MVC)

## Model
Resources that are used in our app
(user model will have User table. Using model we can communicate with the user table)

## View
makes up the front-end of the application
(home page, about page, etc.)
erb = embedded ruby
home.html.erb

## Controller
back-end
Bran behind the application
How user requestes are handled is managed by controller

## MVC Flow

1. Request made at browser
2. Request receieved at router of the app
3. Router route the request to the appropriate Action in the Controller
4. Controller#Action either render a view template or communicate with the model.
5. Model communicate with the Db
6. Model send back the information to the Controller
7. Controller renders the view
